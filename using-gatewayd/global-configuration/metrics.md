# Metrics

GatewayD currently supports a single Prometheus metrics output. It collects, relabels and merges metrics from plugins over Unix Domain Socket and exposes them over HTTP. The aggregated metrics are accessible via [http://localhost:9090/metrics](http://localhost:9090/metrics) by default.

You can add a new [`scrape_config`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config) to your Prometheus config file to scrape the metrics from GatewayD:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "gatewayd"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
```

## Configuration parameters

| Name              | Type              | Default value  | Possible values       | Description                                                                                                          |

| enabled           | boolean           | True           | True, False           | The network protocol to use                                                                                          |
| address           | string            | localhost:9090 | Valid host:port       | The HTTP address and port to expose metrics on                                                                       |
| path              | string            | /metrics       | Valid path values     | The endpoint to expose metrics on                                                                                    |
| readHeaderTimeout | duration (string) | 10s            | Valid duration values | The maximum duration for reading the request headers. Setting this to a non-zero value will block Slowloris attacks. |
| timeout           | duration (string) | 10s            | Valid duration values | The maximum duration before timing out. This applies to writes, reads, idle and handler timeouts separately.         |

## Built-in Metrics

The following are built-in metrics emitted by GatewayD. The namespace of all the metrics is always set to `gatewayd` and all the metrics are prefixed with `gatewayd_`. Emitted metrics from plugins are listed on their own page.
