| ------------------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| verificationPolicy  | string  | passdown      | passdown, ignore, abort, remove | The verification policy controls how the output of the plugin's hook function should be handled and whether to verify the output or not.<br/>- passdown (default): the output of the plugin is passed down to the next plugin, regardless of the result. The result is not verified.<br/>- ignore: the output of the current plugin is ignored if the verification fails, and the next plugin is called with the same input.<br/>- abort: the output of the current plugin is ignored if the verification fails, and the next plugin is not called.<br/>- remove: the output of the current plugin is ignored if the verification fails, and the next plugin is called with the same input. The current registered hook from the current plugin is removed from the list of registered hooks and it will not be called again. |
| compatibilityPolicy | string  | strict        | strict, loose                   | The compatibility policy controls how GatewayD treats plugins' requirements. If a plugin requires a specific version of another plugin, the compatibility policy controls whether to allow or reject the plugin.<br/>- strict (default): the plugin is rejected if it requires a specific version of another plugin and that version is not the one currently loaded.<br/>- loose: the plugin is allowed to run even if it requires a specific version of another plugin and that version is not the one currently loaded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| acceptancePolicy    | string  | accept        | accept, reject                  | The acceptance policy controls how new dynamic hooks are handled. If a plugin registers a new hook, the acceptance policy controls whether to accept or reject the new hook.<br/>- accept (default): the new hook is accepted and registered.<br/>- reject: the new hook is rejected and not registered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| terminationPolicy   | string  | stop          | stop, restart                   | The termination policy controls how to handle the termination of requests. If a plugin terminates a request, the termination policy controls whether to stop executing the remaining plugins or not. If the termination policy is set to "stop", the remaining plugins are not executed. If the termination policy is set to "continue", the remaining plugins are executed. Warning: if the termination policy is set to "continue", the output of the remaining plugins might be passed down to the next plugin, and the result depends on the what the remaining plugins do.<br/>- stop (default): the remaining plugins are not executed.<br/>- continue: the remaining plugins are executed.                                                                                                                             |
| enableMetricsMerger | boolean | True          | True, False                     | If enabled, GatewayD will merge the Prometheus metrics of all plugins over Unix domain socket. The metrics are merged and exposed via the GatewayD [metrics](/global-configuration/metrics) endpoint via HTTP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| metricsMergerPeriod | string  | 5s            | Valid duration strings          | The metrics merger period controls how often the metrics merger should collect and merge metrics from plugins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| healthCheckPeriod   | string  | 5s            | Valid duration strings          | The health check period controls how often the health check should be performed. The health check is performed by pinging each plugin. Unhealthy plugins are removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| reloadOnCrash       | boolean | True          | True, False                     | If enabled, GatewayD will reload the plugin if it crashes. The crash is detected by the health check.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| timeout             | string  | 30s           | Valid duration strings          | The timeout controls how long to wait for a plugin to respond to a request before timing out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
