# Act

Act, a core component of GatewayD, is a policy engine that supports signals, policies and actions. It is used to automate the execution of business rules. The business rules are currently written as expressions in the [Expr](https://github.com/expr-lang/expr) language, with support for external policy engines to come. The expressions are evaluated against the signals received from the plugins and the corresponding actions are executed if the policy expressions evaluate to true (boolean) or any other type recognized by the action.

Previously, there were only a single signal, policy and action, called the `terminatePolicy`, which were hard-coded into the GatewayD codebase. This made it difficult to extend and customize the behavior of GatewayD. With the new Act, based on [this proposal](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/proposals/issues/5), the signals, policies and actions are pluggable and can be extended to support custom requirements. This opens up a wide range of possibilities for customizing the behavior of GatewayD to suit the needs of different use cases. For example, a policy can be written to check if the request is coming from a specific IP address, and if so, the action can be to terminate the request.

For more information about configuring policies, see the plugins' [general configuration](/using-gatewayd/plugins-configuration/general-configurations).

{: .note }
> The Act component is currently under active development and the core functionality is available in the GatewayD and the SDK codebases. The information provided here is based on the proposal and the current state of the development. The documentation will be updated as the development progresses.

## Signals

A signal is a message that is sent to the policy engine to trigger the evaluation of the policies. The signals are generated by the plugins and are sent to the policy engine for evaluation. The signals can be of different types, such as `terminate`, `log`, etc., and can contain different types of data, such as the log message and log level, and whether the signal is enabled or not. A signal consists of two fields:

1. `name`: The name of the signal, such as `terminate`, `log`, etc.
2. `metadata`: The metadata associated with the signal, such as the log message and log level.

For example, [the `terminate` signal](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/gatewayd-plugin-sdk/blob/d978dc626c5ba7e655f303c6dc51e3335292e4af/act/signal.go#L19-L26) can be sent with the following metadata:

```yaml
name: terminate
metadata:
  terminate: true
```

<!-- [Helper functions](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/gatewayd-plugin-sdk/blob/main/act/signal.go) are provided in the SDK to create and send the signals to the policy engine for plugin development. An example of sending a signal can be found in the cache plugin [here](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/gatewayd-plugin-cache/blob/354012088dc5d72d0f3e13bf10a7498eefea4616/plugin/plugin.go#L146-L163). -->

## Policies

A policy is a set of rules that are evaluated against the signals to determine whether the actions should be executed. The policies are written as expressions in the Expr language, with support for external policy engines to come. The expressions are evaluated against the signals received from the plugins and the corresponding actions are executed if the policy expressions evaluate to a type recognized by the action. Policies have the following fields:

1. `name`: The name of the policy, such as `terminate`, `log`, etc.

For example, [the policy](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/gatewayd/blob/6ccf9b70be368fb935dbc133bf547eae9f590630/act/builtins.go#L38-L42) that matches the `terminate` signal can be written as:

```yaml
name: terminate
policy: "Signal.terminate == true && Policy.terminate == 'stop'"
metadata:
  terminate: "stop" # Change this to "continue" to continue the execution
```

## Actions

The action can be run in sync or async mode, and it can return a result or an error. The actions are executed if the policy expressions evaluate to true (boolean) or any other type recognized by the action. The actions have the following fields:

1. `name`: The name of the action, such as `terminate`, `log`, etc.
2. `metadata`: The metadata associated with the action, such as the log message and log level.
3. `sync`: Whether the action should be run in sync or async mode.
4. `terminal`: Whether the action is terminal or not.
5. `run`: The function that is executed when the action is triggered. This is currently written in Go, with support for writing actions in other languages to come.

For example, [the action](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/gatewayd/blob/6ccf9b70be368fb935dbc133bf547eae9f590630/act/builtins.go#L61-L66) that matches the `terminate` policy can be written as:

```yaml
name: terminate
metadata:
  terminate: "stop"
sync: true
terminal: true
```

The terminate function is available [here](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/gatewayd/blob/6ccf9b70be368fb935dbc133bf547eae9f590630/act/builtins.go#L83-L127).

{: .note }
> Signals, policies and actions must have the same name to be matched and executed. For example, the `terminate` signal will be matched with the `terminate` policy and the `terminate` action will be executed if the policy expression evaluates to true.
