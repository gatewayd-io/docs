# Plugin Types

GatewayD supports a variety of plugins, which can be used to extend its functionality. Plugins are in three types:

- **Built-in plugins**

    These plugins are developed by [GatewayD Labs](https://gatewayd.io) and are distributed on their respective repositories. They are almost always distributed as free and open-source software, just like GatewayD. We are responsible for maintaining and supporting these plugins, but we are also open to contributions from the community.

- **Community plugins**

    These plugins are developed by the community and are distributed on their respective repositories. The plugin authors are solely responsible for maintaining and supporting their plugins. We will try to help the plugin authors as much as we can, but we are not responsible for their plugins.

- **Enterprise plugins**

    These plugins are developed by [GatewayD Labs](https://gatewayd.io) and are distributed to paid customers. They are usually distributed with a commercial license. We are responsible for maintaining and supporting these plugins.
